Things that are done:
* cairo wrapper
* argment parsing

Things to do
* argument handling
* different modes for different arguments.
* 

Flow:
* get mode from arguments
* if -r, look for every file with the specified extension and parse it and draw its diagram.
  go down every directory too and get all the files with that filter as well
* if not -r, get every file in that array and read it in, draw that file and output it. Every file gets its
  own drawing.
* each file will have a separate diagram and the result will be put into that file.
